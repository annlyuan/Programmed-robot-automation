🤖 Robotic Automation & Quality Control (EpMotion)
To ensure the high-throughput and reproducibility of million-scale PPI mapping, we integrated an EpMotion automated liquid handling system into our workflow:

Automated Library Construction: Streamlined the complex, multi-step sequencing library preparation process, significantly reducing human error and manual labor.

Standardized Quality Control (QC): Developed automated testing protocols to perform rigorous QC on samples, ensuring consistent data integrity across large datasets.

Human-Machine Interactive Programming: Engineered custom, script-based programs that allow for flexible interaction, enabling rapid protocol optimization and real-time adjustments during the experimental run.

Performance Optimization: The automation platform enables the processing of low-input samples with high precision, maintaining quantification feasibility even in challenging conditions.
